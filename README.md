# Personal-Data

#### ***For Privacy Reasons, the full .py, .ipynb, and commensurate data will not be uploaded

#### Project Goal 
Use free online tools to create a sandbox environment for tracking various behaviors.

### Overview
This project uses many products from Google Suite including Google Forms and Google Sheets to enable control in crafting of the project. 
The APIs are called to streamline the retrieval of personal data, and then different Data Analysis tools are suggested.

## Data Collection

With collecting personal/ behavioral data, there are a variety of free apps and websites; however, while most of these tools will allow one to export the csv of the user's data, the products can have restrictions on what exactly can be tracked in the first place. Using Google Forms provides what variables to control, and ensures the entire pipeline is free (granted that one has access to a phone and internet)

### Google Drive Interface
![Example](https://github.com/jmbost20/Personal-Data/blob/main/github.png)

The first level of interacting with this system is to create a main directory to interact with all of the different google forms
* Everything is stored within the same folder to ensure ease of use (A folder can be pinned and easily opened on the google drive app)


### Google Forms Interface

It is to group similar variables into the same form. If all the variables that are being tracked were put in different forms, it could take longer to scroll and find the applicable form, and by having similar behaviors grouped, the variables are processed easier

DIAGRAM FORM HERE



For this form, each variable is grouped



## Data Processing

#### ***There are tons of different ways to manage initial data. There not one best way!
#### ***Data must first be extracted from Google using either the Google Forms API or the Google Sheets API. This project made use of the forms API.


### Packages

Photo HERE!!!
Some of these packages are more niche and take some work to install

### API Calls



## Returnables

### Options
After the initial data is extracted from google, there are a variety of free softwares available to use for individual purposes. As there is no one best process for representing one's data, a list will be provided of pro's and cons
* Google Sheets
  * Pros

  * Cons
* Excel
* Tableau- great for dashboards
